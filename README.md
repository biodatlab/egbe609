# EGBE 609/606: Fundamental of Biomedical Engineering

Fundamental of Biomedical Engineering Master and Ph.D. Program in Biomedical Engineering. Academic year 2021

- **Objectives**: Understand the role of Machine learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) in Biomedical Science, how to make sense of data (why making model), know the role of data in ML (data-centric AI, data collection), know the potential drawback for using these applications (bias). Understand the importance of how we build ML models and how to do it. This class is to prepare you to get ready for building models but we do not need you to perform serious programming in this class.
